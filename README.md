# Lessons Learned
One of the main lessons that I learned on this project is that I really need to try and think about the 
application frontend layout a little more before I start adding HTML, CSS or related BootStrap components.  I found that I built some pages as I went along and overlooked the end state application as seen by a user and also keeping the front end DRY.  This added additional work in refactoring several pieces and caused me headaches when trying to implement consistency of look and feel across screens and implmenting partials successfully at the end of the project.




# Approach:
The purpose of this application was to give homeowners and home project enthusiasts a place to come together to share tool information on tools that they have used and value.  It is also a place where these users can come together and organize their tool collections based on categorizations such as "Essential plumbing tools for a homeowner" or "My Gardening 101 toolkit".  This is to allow users of the site to review what others have in their tool collections and gain some insight on what they may look to purchase if they plan to create a tool kit for a similar purpose or just general needs.
